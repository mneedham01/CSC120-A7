Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In House.java-- 
First, I overloaded the moveIn method so you could move an entire house in at once without having to specify names. Then, I overloaded moveOut so you can move a resident out by their order in the Array List. 

In Library.java-- 
I overloaded the constructor twice. First, there is a way to create a library with just the name. Then, there is a way to create a library with just the name and the number of floors.

In Cafe.java--
First, I overloaded the sellCoffee method so you can sell coffee without dealing withe the cream and sugar. Then, I overloaded the restock method so that you can just restock the coffee. 

This was an easier assignment. The only stumbling was when I got confused about the elevator and how that would affect goToFloor. I would say to review the class slides.
